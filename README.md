# MealSecure

Food security is the measure of the availability of food and individuals' ability to access it. According to the United Nations' Committee on World Food Security, food security is defined as all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their food preferences and dietary needs for an active and healthy life. Food insecurity has been a major issue throughout history and it continues to be a problem today. However, not many people in the US are aware of the food deserts and lack of access people have to sufficient nutrition in their own communities.

For our HackGT 8 project, we created a website where people can learn about food accessibility in their communities by entering their county, state and census tract code. With our site, we are trying to educate people about food accessibility around them and urging them to contribute in making an easy supply of nutritious food a reality for everyone. We have compiled a list of non-profit organizations for people to support. These organizations are working diligently to ensure food security for all. This shows people how their donation can make an impact in people's daily lives and overall health in communities far away and close to home.
